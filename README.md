# lein-docker

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/arohner/lein-docker/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/arohner/lein-docker)

A Leiningen plugin to perform simple docker tasks. Mainly intended for use in continuous-deployment pipelines.

## Usage

In your project.clj, add a key:

```clojure
  :docker {:repo "foo/bar"}
```

`lein docker` supports two commands right now: build and push.


### build

    $ lein docker build

Builds a docker image, using the dockerfile at the root of the project
dir. Uses the repo name from the project.clj, and tags the image with
the project.clj version. If the version contains SNAPSHOT, it will be
replaced with the current datetime.

### push

    $ lein docker push [<version>]

Performs a simple docker push. Can optionally pass an explicit
version, or `:latest`, which will push the most recent tag from this
repo.
